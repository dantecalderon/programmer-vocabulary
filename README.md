- *[Homoiconicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity)*: is a property of some programming languages. A language is homoiconic if a program written 
in it can be manipulated as data using the language, and thus the program's internal representation can be inferred
just by reading the program itself. For example, a Lisp program is written as a regular Lisp list, 
and can be manipulated by other Lisp code. In homoiconic languages, all code can be accessed and transformed as data, 
using the same representation. This property is often summarized by saying that the language treats "code as data".
